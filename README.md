## Feed forward neural network model for digit recognition

- practice a FFNN model for digit recognition. 
  - hyperparameter optimization
  -  regularization (drop out, early stopping) 
  -  different optimization algorithms 
  -  save the model in tensor flow lite format.
  
- the mobile app side uses the model. in real-time takes a stream of video from the camera and predicts for every frame and shows the predicted digit.
